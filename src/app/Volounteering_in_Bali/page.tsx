            I am incredibly grateful for this unforgettable experience in Bali.
            Through the Global Team Internship, I not only had the opportunity
            to immerse myself in a vibrant culture but also met so many amazing
            people, many of whom I know will remain lifelong friends.
            Additionally, I was able to develop and strengthen essential skills,
            such as public speaking, time management, and teamwork, which will
            undoubtedly benefit me in the future. This journey has left a
            lasting impact on me, both personally and professionally, and I will
            cherish the memories and lessons learned for years to come.
