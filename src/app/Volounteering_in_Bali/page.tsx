        In June 2024, I participated in the
        <span className="font-bold ml-1"> Global Team Internship in Bali </span>
        Global Team Internship in Bali, Indonesia, an immersive program centered
        around Ubud Village. During this experience, I lived in Mas Village, a
        small traditional community located 6 kilometers south of Ubud, renowned
        for its intricate woodcarving artistry. The internship aimed to support
        local businesses and charities by developing practical and sustainable
        solutions to their challenges, while also fostering cultural exchange
        and personal growth.
