        In June 2024, I participated in the
        <span className="font-bold ml-1"> Global Team Internship in Bali </span>
        Global Team Internship in Bali, Indonesia, an immersive program centered
        around Ubud Village. During this experience, I lived in Mas Village, a
        small traditional community located 6 kilometers south of Ubud, renowned
        for its intricate woodcarving artistry. The internship aimed to support
        local businesses and charities by developing practical and sustainable
        solutions to their challenges, while also fostering cultural exchange
        and personal growth.

        <p className="text-start">
          I am incredibly grateful for this unforgettable experience in Bali.
          Through the Global Team Internship, I not only had the opportunity to
          immerse myself in a vibrant culture but also met so many amazing
          people, many of whom I know will remain lifelong friends.
          Additionally, I was able to develop and strengthen essential skills,
          such as public speaking, time management, and teamwork, which will
          undoubtedly benefit me in the future. This journey has left a lasting
          impact on me, both personally and professionally, and I will cherish
          the memories and lessons learned for years to come.
